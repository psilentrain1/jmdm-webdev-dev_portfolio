# James' Dev Portfolio

This website serves as my dev portfolio. It's currently very much a work in progress.

It's built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), utilizing its frontend and backend components.

### View the Live Site

The live site can be viewed at [jamesdraketech.com](https://jamesdraketech.com).

I'm self-hosting it on an Oracle Cloud instance.

### Running the Site Locally

If you'd like to check out the code and test locally, use the following steps.

1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.

2. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/psilentrain1/jmdm-webdev-dev_portfolio.git

3. Load up the demo database, by running from the project root:

```

4. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

5. Start the development server:

```

6. Then, browse to the address shown in terminal, i.e. `http://localhost:3000`

7. Have a browse around!
